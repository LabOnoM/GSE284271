# Single Cell Spatial Transcriptomics of the Murine Embryonic Palate Links Pax9 to Patterning and Organization of Extracellular Matrix Components

This repository hosts the codes for the original analysis of [GSE284271](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE284271).

## 01 Prerequisites

To reproduce the results of our published article, the output of [`spaceranger`](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/space-ranger/latest) has to be prepared by using all data from [GSE284271](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE284271) by yourself.

We recommend opening the [`00.NIH_10xVisiumHD.rmd`](https://github.com/LabOnoM/GSE284271/blob/main/00.NIH_10xVisiumHD.rmd) R notebook file by using [Rstudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).

We recommend opening the [`01.scRNAseq10xVisiumHD.ipynb`](https://github.com/LabOnoM/GSE284271/blob/main/01.scRNAseq10xVisiumHD.ipynb) file by using the [Python Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

The OS platform, R environments, R packages, and Python modules can be checked in the `sessionInfo()` results under the **Supplementary** section of the [analysis report](https://labonom.github.io/GSE284271/00.NIH_10xVisiumHD.html#Supplementary) and the [Jupyter Notebook results](https://labonom.github.io/GSE284271/01.scRNAseq10xVisiumHD.html).

To check the original results as same as in our original article, please visit our analysis report website ([https://labonom.github.io/GSE284271/01.scRNAseq10xVisiumHD.html](https://labonom.github.io/GSE284271/01.scRNAseq10xVisiumHD.html)).
